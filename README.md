# Database-Management-System-C

We implement a new tiny database-like system from scratch. The following parts are handled:

1 - Storage Manager: Implementing a storage manager that allows read/writing of blocks to/from a file on disk.

2 - Buffer Manager: Implementing a buffer manager that manages a buffer of blocks in memory including reading/flushing to disk and block replacement (flushing blocks to disk to make space for reading new blocks from disk).

3 - Record Manager: Implementing a simple record manager that allows navigation through records, and inserting and deleting records
